# Example 07:

# Now that we've set up the necessary policy, Filip can start submitting purchase orders for approval. His first order
# is the one with reference "MCRN-02". When he attempts to submit that order, the system will trigger a check to see if
# he has the appropriate permission with the following query:

match
$u isa user, has email "filip.inaros@vaticle.com";
$po isa purchase-order, has reference "MCRN-02";
$o isa operation, has name "submit order";
$ac ($po, $o) isa access;
$p ($u, $ac) isa permission, has validity true;

# This successfully returns a result, meaning that Filip has permission to submit the order.

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 07:

# Use TypeDB Studio's explanations feature to find out how Filip inheritted this permission. To switch on
# explanations, toggle the "snapshot", "infer", and "explain" buttons to on. After executing the query, double-click on
# an inferred concept (one with a green outline) to find out how it was inferred from a rule. After using the
# explanations feature, remember to close the transaction with the "â¨‰" button.
