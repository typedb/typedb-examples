# Example 02:

# Now let's insert a new threat actor, a new malware and create an attribution relation between them.
# We will also add a new malware, bravo-malware, as well as a new threat-actor, bravo-threat.
# We will then use them both to create a new attributed-to relation.

insert

# Exercise 03:

# Display the threat-actor created in this example.
# Then Write a new query to give bravo-threat a third threat actor type: "insider".
# Try re-display the threat-actor to see the results of this insert query.
# Keyword hints: match, insert
# Type hints: threat-actor, threat-actor-type, id
