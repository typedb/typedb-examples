# Example 01:

# Let's start by getting a list of id-unknown in the database.
#
# We are querying for a list of actors with unknown ids.
# $t and $attribute are variables, which are used in the query.
# The query is a get query containing a single pattern matching statement.
# The query will return all the entities of type id-unknown in the database and their attributes.

match  
$t isa id-unknown, has $attribute;

# Exercise 01:

# Edit this query to show only the name and description of our id-unknown.
# Type hints: name, description
