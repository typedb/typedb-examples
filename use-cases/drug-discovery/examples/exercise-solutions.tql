# Solutions

# The solutions to each of the exercises can be found here. To run the query in a solution: make sure the correct
# session and transaction type are selected, highlight the intended query, right click and select "Run Selection".

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 01 solution:

match
$g isa gene, has id "ACKR4", has id $id;

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 02 solution:

match
$p isa protein, has id $p-id;
$p-id == "O00763";
$pe ($p, $g) isa protein-encoding;
$g isa gene, has id $g-id;

# Double-clicking on the protein-encoding twice causes transcription and translation relations to appear each time, but
# doing so a third time causes a message to be displayed, indicating that there are no further explanations. This shows
# that the database contains two splice variants for the encoding of protein O00763 by gene ACACB.

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 03 solution:

match
$g isa gene, has id $id;
$id == "LAP3";
$ce ($g, $c) isa cell-expression;
$c isa cell, has name $c-n;
$tc ($c, $t) isa tissue-composition;
$t isa tissue, has name $t-n;
$t-n == "kidney";

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 04 solution:

match
$t isa tissue, has name "hippocampus";
$te ($t, $p) isa tissue-enhancement;
$p isa protein, has function-description $f;
$pe ($p, $g) isa protein-encoding;
$g isa gene, has gene-symbol like "LRR.*";

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 05 solution:

match
$g1 isa gene, has gene-symbol $g1-s;
$pe1 ($g1, $p1) isa protein-encoding;
$p1 isa protein, has uniprot-id "O60240";
$ppa ($p1, $p2) isa protein-protein-association;
$p2 isa protein, has uniprot-id "Q8WTS1";
$pe2 ($p2, $g2) isa protein-encoding;
$g2 isa gene, has gene-symbol $g2-s;

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 06 solution:

match
$v isa virus, has name "MHV";
$d isa drug, has name $n;
$pvt ($v, $d) isa potential-virus-treatment;

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 07 solution:

match
$di isa disease, has name "Neoplasms";

$p isa protein, has primary-uniprot-name $n;
$drpi ($p, $dr) isa drug-protein-interaction;
$dr isa drug, has name "CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE";

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 08 solution:

match
$di isa disease, has name "Neoplasms";
$dipi ($di, $p1) isa disease-protein-interaction;
$p1 isa protein;
$pp1 ($p1, $pa1) isa pathway-participation;
$pa1 isa pathway, has name $pa1-n;
$pp2 ($pa1, $p2) isa pathway-participation;
$p2 isa protein;
$pp3 ($p2, $pa2) isa pathway-participation;
$pa2 isa pathway, has name $pa2-n;
$pp4 ($pa2, $p3) isa pathway-participation;
$p3 isa protein;
$drpi ($p3, $dr) isa drug-protein-interaction;
$dr isa drug, has name "NIVOLUMAB";
