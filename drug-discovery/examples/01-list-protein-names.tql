# Example 01:

# Let's start by getting the names of the protein Q9NPB9:

match
$p isa protein, has id "Q9NPB9", has name $n;

# We should see one protein represented by an entity with nine name attributes, which are the two variables we bound in
# our query. If we look closely at the attributes, we can see that there are actually three types: primary-uniprot-name,
# alternative-uniprot-name, and uniprot-entry-name. This is because all three of these types are subtypes of name, and
# so are valid results for the query. This is an example of TypeDB's polymorphism feature at work, where we've
# constructed a query that will return results of different types.

# Exercise 01:

# Edit this query to get all the IDs of the gene ACKR4.
# Type hints: gene, id
