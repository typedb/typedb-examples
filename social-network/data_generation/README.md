# Data Generator

Intended to generate new datasets for the social media example.

** Outdated **

These sources are targeting a TypeDB 2.x version of this example, which uses a slightly different schema (even considering purely syntactic updates)!

The old schema is retained here in case anyone wishes to understand the difference between the 3.x schema and the old 2.x schema and update the query generator accordingly
