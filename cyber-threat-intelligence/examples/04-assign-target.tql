# Example 04:

# Now let's insert a new targets relation between a specific malware and a specific id-unknown.
# We will use the stix-id attribute to identify the malware and the name attribute to identify the id-unknown.
# We will also assign a stix-id attribute to identify the new targets relation.

match
$bravo-id isa id-unknown, has name "Adversary Bravo";
$bravo-ma isa malware, has stix-id "bravo-malware";

insert
(targeting: $bravo-ma, targeted: $bravo-id) isa targets,
    has stix-id "bravo-targets";
    
#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 04:

# Write a new query to find the id-unknown with stix-id "bravo-id-unknown" as well as the malware with stix-id "bravo-malware"
# and then, create a uses relationship to descibe the fact that the id-unknown is using the malware.
# You will need to give a new unique stix-id to your uses relationship.
# Keyword hints: match, insert, has
# Type hints: id-unknown, malware, uses
