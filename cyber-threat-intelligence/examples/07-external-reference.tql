# Example 07:

# From the previous example, we can see that some attack patterns are used by intrusion sets.
# We can also see that some attack patterns have external references.
# We can use the same approach to find attack patterns that are used by intrusion sets and have external references.

match 

$e isa external_reference;
$e has $eid;
$a isa attack_pattern;
$rel (referencing: $a, referenced: $e) isa external_references;

    
#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 07:

# Find all attack patterns that are used by intrusion sets and have external references.
# Return the name of the attack pattern, the name of the intrusion set, and the external reference ID.
# Order by the name of the attack pattern.
# Keyword hints: match, sort
# Type hints: attack_pattern, intrusion_set, external_reference
