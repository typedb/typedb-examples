# Advent of TypeQL 2025

This repository contains the sources and texts for the 2025 Advent of TypeQL. It is a fun, daily way to learn TypeQL in a Christmas themed setting!

## Format

Each day will be one file/blog post. There will be 14 days from December 11 to December 24, inclusive.

The first day will come with a setup schema and data file, and subsequent days will build up on previous days' work. 
However, each subsequent day will also have a shortcut setup to just setup a database for that day's activity.

## Usage

It's likely you'll use [TypeDB Studio](https://studio.typedb.com) or [TypeDB Console](https://typedb.com/docs/home/install/console-cli/) running against a [TypeDB Cloud](https://cloud.typedb.com) or local instance of [TypeDB CE](https://typedb.com/docs/home/install/ce/).

If you encounter any errors, want to chat, please open an issue, post in our [Discord Help Forum or Discussion channel](https://typedb.com/discord), or [email me directly](mailto:joshua@typedb.com).

Have fun!
